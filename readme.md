#MailTrack Android Technical Test

###This is the resultant App for the Android Test for MailTrack.

The App is a Wi-Fi SSID discoverer.
I just **shows into a webView (using JS code) the SSID info obtained with native Android code**.

With the *"Refresh"* menu option the user can **re-obtaine the SSID info and refresh de webView text**.
